Here is list of projects I worked on. For the sake of confidentiality, I will provide only the minimum information.

## Simulink operating point search
This was the major cross-team R&D project I participated at MathWorks. The client makes backhoe machine and needed enhanced feature in Simulink control design to effectively trim the model (i.e., find the operating point). I led the work on reformulating the optimization problem in model trimming and developed the enhanced features. See the two new options ```graddescent-proj``` and ```lsqnonlin-proj``` in [MathWorks Documentation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/slcontrol/ug/findopoptions.html)

## Truck-trailer planning and control
As the tech lead in controls at ISEE AI, I prototyped the first version of control systems (speed regulation, steering, and gear shifting) for autonomous yard trucks. I also designed the first interface between planner and controller. See [ISEE AI's official website](https://www.isee.ai) for more details.

(Note: I left ISEE AI in April 2020. There is no non-compete restrictions.)

## Preview Suspension Control
This has been my major focus at Clearmotion. We collected road surface data and use that for feedforward control of active suspension control. See [The RoadMotion Project](https://www.clearmotion.com/roadmotion/) for more details.

## Torque vectoring
The client is making a certain type of vehicles that can distribute individual torques to different wheels. I helped with formulating it into an optimazation problem to achieve optimal torque vectoring and implemented a real-time solver for it.

## ACC Controller Design for OTR Trucks
The client is making electrical over-the-road trucks, and the scope of the consulting work is to prototype the first version of a adaptive cruise controller from scratches.

## Simscape modeling and MBD design
The client is making excavator-like heavy equipment for mining purpose. The work is to provide training and guidance on simscape modeling on the hydraulic cylindar and on simscape multibody. Also, training on model-based-design workflow with speedgoat is provided.
