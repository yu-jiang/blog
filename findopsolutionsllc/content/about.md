## About me
**Findop Solutions LLC** is a technical consulting company founded in early 2020 by me, Yu Jiang. I am a controls engineer (or more broadly, an applied mathematician) based in the Greater Boston Area, MA. I hold a PhD degree in Electrical Engineering (minored in Mathematics) from the [New York University (NYU)](https://www.nyu.edu). 

### Academia
I have a strong publication track record in academia, including a few first-authored research papers published on IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control (TAC) and Automatica. The bulk of my PhD research work on reinforcement learning and nonlinear control has been published into the book ["Robust Adaptive Dynamic Programming"](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Robust+Adaptive+Dynamic+Programming-p-9781119132646). I received the Shimamura Young Author Prize at the 9th Asian Control Confereence. See my [Google Scholar Page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QYanTRsAAAAJ&hl=en) for more details.

### Industry

I also have 8+ years of experiences working in industry. I worked full-time at [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com), [ClearMotion](https://www.clearmotion.com), and [ISEE AI](https://www.isee.ai). In addition, I have also worked on a good number of consulting projects related to controls in robotics and autonomous driving for my clients around the world. See [Projects](...) for a list of projects I worked on.
