Today, I started to play around the camera calibration app in MATLAB Autonomous Driving System Toolbox to calibrate the intrinsic parameters.

The app applis the Zhang's method (checker board method) to quickly calibrate the parameters we need.

See [MathWorks Documentation for more details](https://www.mathworks.com/help/vision/ug/using-the-single-camera-calibrator-app.html) 

I used [this link](https://calib.io/pages/camera-calibration-pattern-generator) to generate the checker board, and have it printed at Fedex.
