## About me
**Findop Solutions LLC** is a technical consulting company founded in early 2020 by me, Yu Jiang. I hold a PhD degree in Electrical Engineering (minored in Mathematics) from the New York University (NYU), and I am specialized in formulating and solving optimization and control problems in autonomous driving and robotics in general.  I am based in the Greater Boston Area, MA. See [My Homepage](https://yu-jiang.github.io) for more details about me.

### Academia
I have a strong publication track record in academia, including a few first-authored research papers published on IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control (TAC) and Automatica. The bulk of my PhD research work on reinforcement learning and nonlinear control has been published into the book ["Robust Adaptive Dynamic Programming"](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Robust+Adaptive+Dynamic+Programming-p-9781119132646). I received the Shimamura Young Author Prize at the 9th Asian Control Conference. I serve as an active reviewer for many prestigious conferences and top journals in control systems society. See my [Google Scholar Page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QYanTRsAAAAJ&hl=en) for more details on my publications. 

### Industry

I have 8+ years of experiences working in industry. I was the core developer of Simuink Control Design at [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com). I worked as a senior controls engineer and become a principal scientist at [ClearMotion](https://www.clearmotion.com). I was the tech lead at [ISEE AI](https://www.isee.ai) where I started and grew the controls team. In addition, I have also worked on a good number of consulting projects related to controls in robotics and autonomous driving for my clients around the world. See [Services](/services/) for a list of sample projects I worked on.
